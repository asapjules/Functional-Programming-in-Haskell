{-
Lab10Def.hs defines the State monad and a binary tree type.  Please take a look.

You job: Working with the State monad, implement numberHelper below to convert a
binary tree to a new binary tree that has the same shape, but the elements are
Int's, and the numbers go in the order 0, 1, 2,... in the tree's in-order.
There is an example below.

You should not need to maintain your own counter; use the state for the counter.
Also You should not need to write your own "StateOf (\s0 -> ...)" directly; you
should only need put, get, Functor+Applicative+Monad methods, and recursion.
